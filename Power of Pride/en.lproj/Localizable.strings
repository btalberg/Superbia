"Superbia is based on Professor Dr. JoAnne Terrell's class Augustine, Niebuhr, & Malcolm X as delivered at Chicago Theological Seminary in the fall of 2011.

Saint Augustine of Hippo and Reinhold Niebuhr each emphasize humankind's sinful nature. They believed that the human was naturally inclined to sin, through pride and sensuality. Much of Western culture's concept of being and right living extend from this disparing view of human nature. Although Augustine and Niebuhr's thinking exudes God's goodness, their theological anthropology has been had a major detrimental impact on many people, particularly the oppressed, including women and African-Americans. Malcolm X offers an implicit critique of popular Christian's view of humanity. A theologian himself, Malcolm saw the danger in an oppressed people eschewing pride.

Superbia, Latin for Pride, focuses on the concept of pride as understood by Augustine, Niebuhr, and Malcolm. Holding these three philosophers under the same light allows traditional ideas about existence and right living to be challenged and expanded.";
