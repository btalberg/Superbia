		<string>Saint Augustine of Hippo has arguably been the most influential theologian in the history of Christian thought. Saint Augustine was born in modern Algeria in North Africa. In 391, at the age of 37, Augustine was named the priest of Hippo Regius. Four years later he became bishop. The theologian was a prolific sermonizer and writer, developing a concept of Christianity that became the cornerstone of many orthodox beliefs. Most notably are the common Western ideas of original sin, salvation through faith, and the concept of &apos;just war&apos;.

Augustine was influenced by a life of experience. His personal battle with lust, and his several years of experience within the Gnostic group the Manichaeans, helped to shape the belief that human nature is self-indulgent and prideful. The explanation for Augustine&apos;s belief was rooted in the Genesis story of Adam and Eve. Augustine reasoned that the fall of Adam stained the human will so that it became incapable of goodness. In contrast to the beliefs of some, such as the Pelagians who followed an ascetic named Pelagius, Augustine believed the redemption of the will could only be achieved through God&apos;s grace. Without Christ&apos;s atoning sacrifice, humanity would be doomed.

Some of Augustine&apos;s most influential works are the City of God, written in responsible to the fall of Rome, and Confessions, an autobiographical piece outlining Augustine&apos;s experience with sin and his journey toward Christian conversion. The Enchiridion on Faith, a short manual on orthodox belief, lays out Augustine&apos;s basic understanding of the relationship between faith, charity, and hope. Amongst these, and many other writings, Augustine established pride as the cornerstone of all sin and grace through faith as the requirement to right living. Later, Reinhold Niebuhr would adopt the essential qualities of Augustine&apos;s theology in the construction of his theological anthropologies related to the individual and the group.</string>
		<key>themes</key>
		<string>Concupiscence: Sin characterized by the privation of good. A human tendency to turn all things into objects of lust.

Pelagians: Led by Pelagius in the mid 4th - early 5th century. Believed mankind was not stained by Adam&apos;s fall from grace. Humans were able to do good works without grace.

Donatists: A group of Christian fundamentalists. To Augustine, they belittled the power of Church authority by limiting the effectiveness of imperfect priests. They called for the removal of all priests who denounced Christianity during Roman persecution.

Just War: Largely constructed through tension with the Donatists. The idea that war, violence, was justified in particular cases.

Pride of Knowledge: All true knowledge proceeds directly from God. Right knowledge&apos;s source is in the divine. Pride of knowledge is the idea that truth can be found in the corporeal.

Evil: The privation of good or a lack of goodness. For Augustine everything created is good and has an order, a purpose. Wherever and whenever that order or purpose is misconstrued, when something or someone acts as if its more or less than it should be, evil is exhibited.

God&apos;s will: God is completely good, and only wills goodness. God&apos;s will is so powerful it can even turn cases of evil into goodness.

Faith/Hope/Charity: Three important facets of Christian living as laid out in the Enchiridion on Faith.

Resurrection of Bodies: Augustine believed all creation was essentially good, including bodies. At Christ&apos;s return all bodies would be resurrected to walk on Earth.</string>

		<string>Reinhold Niebuhr was a neo-orthodox theologian. Niebuhr focused on realism versus idealism. He actively critiqued the delusion of utopia he felt many people had adopted in the 20th century. Niebuhr became more ardent in his views following WWII and the atrocities that took place wherein.

Niebuhr grew up in Missouri, the son of German immigrants. His father was a pastor and his brother Richard Niebuhr became a well known religious historian. Early on, Niebuhr led an active ministry as a pastor in Detroit. Unjust working situations amidst auto-workers led him into vocal contention with Ford. Here he began his criticism of liberal optimism believing that the progress of technology and industry was making life unbearable for many to provide a utopic ideal for few. Niebuhr&apos;s realism would expand as the theologian observed more and more injustices in society, especially when viewing large group dynamics modeled through international affairs and political corruption.

A central, defining concept of Niebuhr is his Christian realism. With any familiarity of Augustine, one will quickly notice Niebuhr&apos;s grounding in Augustine&apos;s Biblical realism. Understanding humankind as inheritably prideful creatures; Niebuhr rejected idealist and rationalistic philosophy. He urged individuals, specifically Christians, to recognize their pride (self-love) and inclination toward sin. Niebuhr ascribed to individuals a &quot;permanent malevolence&quot; (Rasmussen, p. 131) that was evident in both &quot;individual and collective self-interest&quot; (ibid.). Focusing on the latter, a symptom and exacerbation of the former, Niebuhr rejected both liberalism&apos;s hope of societal perfection through love and good will, and orthodox Protestantism&apos;s unbridled relinquishing of political authority to government &quot;on the ground God ordained it to prevent anarchy&quot; (p. 129). Applied to our modern state, which is experiencing ever greater economic disparity, more global conflict, and pitiful incompetence from our two party system, Niebuhr&apos;s critique may be as relevant and powerful as in the mid 20th century. Speaking to Christians and contrasting idealism, Niebuhr said &quot;[it is an] illusion to believe the kingdom of Caesar is the Kingdom of Christ in embryo&quot; (p. 134). As the Christian realist, Niebuhr calls us to recognize that &quot;every moment of human history [has] contained higher possibilities of good and every statesman [has the duty to correct injustices] so the vision of the Kingdom of Christ [is] not limited to a luxury limited for those whom transcended the effects of present injustices&quot; (p. 134-135). Niebuhr doesn&apos;t say hope is lost in humanity, he is instead calling us to humility (realism) as we forsake idealism in search of a system that is ever mindful toward correcting its own bend toward injustice.

This highly dubious notion of humanity&apos;s ability to achieve perfection is attributed to humanity&apos;s state. Paralleling a kind of Augustinian dichotomy, Niebuhr identified sin through the means of either religious or moral expression (p. 137). Humanity, being both free and finite, operated under a sense of anxiety (p. 138). Our response to this anxiety is to mask finiteness by &quot;raising [our] contingent existence to unconditioned significance&quot; (p. 141) or to cope with freedom, &quot;fall into sensuality, immersing self in ‘mutable good&apos;&quot; (ibid.). Ever cognizant of the collective, Niebuhr applied these forms of sin in the context of the social group.

Niebuhr used the phrase &quot;equality of sin, inequality of guilt&quot; (p. 153). Attributing pride to each individual and group, all are sinners. However, for Niebuhr not all individuals and groups were equally guilty of their sin. He writes &quot;those who hold great economic and political power are more guilty of pride against God and of injustice against the weak than those who lack power and prestige.&quot; (p. 154). The more secure group exhibits a kind of pride of finite unconsciousness, exhibiting a self-sustaining and unrighteous control over lesser groups. The weaker groups, the oppressed, aware of this insecurity will seek security, but often do so at the expense of others (p. 142). The weak entity&apos;s sin proceeds in reaction to the powerful. One example that comes to mind is the toppling of Egypt&apos;s government. In the face of injustice, a weaker group consolidated and took control. However, as Niebuhr warned, the weaker group is always apt to continue the former abuses of the prior power. This is evident in Egypt as new power coalitions seek to perpetuate many of the same policies and doctrines enacted by the group they overthrew.

Niebuhr&apos;s writings urge us to recognize our inclination toward self-glorification or self-mutilation which perpetuates systems of injustice. He writes, &quot;man&apos;s release from bondage to self involves emancipation from anxiety about death&quot; (p. 197). Niebuhr states the &quot;final law of human existence is agape, a movement of ‘grace&apos; which draws the self out of itself despite itself into the love of God and the neighbor&quot; (p. 196). Niebuhr, as a realist, calls for both secular and religious entities to operate in tandem, reminding each other of humanity&apos;s finitude while striving to keep social forces and political powers in check so &quot;false sanctities and idolatries of both traditional societies and modern tyrannies are prevented&quot; (p. 256). Niebuhr&apos;s realism is sobering but refreshing as he identifies why the ‘city of man&apos; historically is in continual struggle. Through an Augustinian lens, he encourages humankind to acknowledge its imperfection, reject hope in the materialization of utopian society, and recognize a mandated duty to act within our limited capacity to bring about a more fair form of justice. A serious reflection upon and application of Niebuhr&apos;s work would be a benefit in our modern world which seems to continually suffer from greater brokenness. Especially as we move further into the 21st century, a century built on a globalized economy, and a delusion of bringing about perfection through technological prowess.

		<key>themes</key>
		<string>Constitutional Anxiety: The tension between freedom and finitude. Humankind is anxious because life is limited and dependent, but not so limited that humankind knows this limitation.

Pride of Power/Virtue/Knowledge: The belief that humankind can attain complete power, virtue, and knowledge. Utopianism/idealism is a model for this kind of pride.

Sin of Sensuality: Represents the prideful assertion of oneself, or the flight of oneself into another. Closely related to the Augustine&apos;s concept of concupiscence. Where the pride of power/virtue/knowledge was often associated with the powerful, the sin of sensuality was associated to the oppressed.

Self-love: The sin of sensuality executed through excessive self love.

Agape: The ideal of a person. Modeled through sacrificial love.

Christian Realism: Belief in the sovereignty of God. More exactly, that the kingdom of heaven could not be established on Earth through human ambition. A rejection of human innocence and human perfectibility.</string>

		<string>Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska. He was raised by his mother after his father&apos;s murder. As a teenager, Malcolm&apos;s mother, tasked with raising several children alone in a society with almost no opportunity for a black woman to succeed, suffered a nervous breakdown. This forced Malcolm into foster care until 16 when he moved to Boston to live with his sister.

In Boston Malcolm fell into a life of petty crime. Eventually, Malcolm was arrested for theft and sentenced to eight years in prison. In prison Malcolm began an ardent pursuit of knowledge, reading and studying prolifically. Members of his family, already knowledgeable of the black nationalism movement through their father&apos;s involvement as a preacher for Marcus Garvey, introduced Malcolm to a relatively new movement called the Nation of Islam. The Nation spoke to Malcolm&apos;s pursuit for identify, and after leaving prison, Malcolm became a spokesperson for Elijah Muhammed&apos;s movement.

Malcolm X, the name he adopted as a member of the Nation of Islam, became a powerful critic of the United States, and its treatment of black citizens, Afro-Americans as Malcolm would say. He originally operated within the theology and message of the Nation&apos;s leader. However, tensions between Muhammed and Malcolm would eventually cause an irreconcilable split.

As Malcolm expanded his theology to a more universal concept of humanity, he would become more interested in traditional Islam. Malcolm eventually made the pilgrimage to Mecca, and officially became a member of Sunni Islam. At Malcolm&apos;s conversion, he changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. In 1965 Malcolm was shot and killed by members of the Nation of Islam.

Malcolm was a black nationalist, and called for a separation of black people and white people. His views were based on his observation and experience of a highly injustice system. Malcolm believed that Afro-Americans were born into a society that taught them they were innately a lesser people. Malcolm spoke powerfully against this system, urging the oppressed peoples to understand they were uniquely endowed by a divine creator. That they were valued by this creator, made in this creator&apos;s image. Malcolm claimed that white people robbed Afro-Americans of their power, and that they were warranted, as the divine&apos;s creation, to take their power back. Mainstream media pictured Malcolm as angry and hateful. Malcolm was angry, but he expressed his anger through words, not violence. More exactly, Malcolm&apos;s mission, of helping black people unite through a sense of pride, was driven more by the love of his people and the love of God, than it was ever motivated by hate.</string>

		<string>Nation of Islam: Black nationalist movement founded by Wallace D. Fard. Later led by Elijah Poole (Muhammed). Religious movement through which Malcolm X would find his voice, become a leader of for several years, and would eventually leave for orthodox Sunni Islam.

Allah: Name of the God of Islam. Within the Nation of Islam, Allah was believed to have been reincarnated as Wallace D. Fard.

Black Nationalism: A call for black unity and communal separation. In Malcolm&apos;s case, he called for the separation of black peoples from the domination of white society. Malcolm was especially influenced by the nationalist movement started by Marcus Garvey.

Myth of Yakub: The Nation of Islam&apos;s cosmogonical myth. Attributed the white race to a race of devils. Was a means by which Malcolm and the Nation equipped oppressed people with a fundamental belief that they were created good and in God&apos;s image.

By any Means Necessary: A common phrase used by Malcolm to urge people to adopt a higher sense of self-importance and self-value. Malcolm argued that viewing self as made in God&apos;s image and being recognized by others as an individual valued by God was so important and fundamental that it should be defended and pursued by any means necessary.

Paternalism: Dominant in the theology and praxis of the Nation of Islam. A response to the feeling of emasculation as felt by the lack of power black men had in relation to dominating white power structures.</string>
