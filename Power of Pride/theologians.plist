		<string>Saint Augustine of Hippo is one of the most influential writers in the field of Christian thought.Saint Augustine was born in what is now modern Algeria in North Africa.  Augustine&apos;s story, interesting similar to that of Malcolm&apos;s, was one of continual transformation. Augustine was raised Christian, but left to join a group called the Manichaens. Their belief system was a kind of gnosticism that borrowed from Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity. Eventually Augustine would leave the Manichaens as he was left with more questions than answers. Pursuing answers to the human relationship to the world, Augustine became interested in Platonism.  This acted as a natural segway back into Christianity.

Augustine was perpetually at war with himself. Raised in a culture of absolute moralism, Augustine would continually battle his sexual desires. This battle would lend to an important concept, concupiscence, a vain yearning of a person&apos;s soul toward good. Vain, because without centering the soul&apos;s focus on God, all things a person desires become a thing of lust and compulsion. Augustine argued that the source of our sin was Adam, and the fall of mankind due to our prideful nature. Augustine writings would establish pride as the cornerstone of all sin. Later, Reinhold Niebuhr would adopt the essential qualities of Augustine&apos;s concept of mankind in relation to the divine.</string>

		<string>A central, defining concept of Niebuhr is his Christian realism. With any familiarity of Augustine, one will quickly notice Niebuhr's grounding in Augustine's Biblical realism. Understanding humankind as inheritably prideful creatures; Niebuhr rejected idealist and rationalistic philosophy. He urged individuals, specifically Christians, to recognize their pride (self-love) and inclination toward sin. Niebuhr ascribed to individuals a "permanent malevolence" (p. 131) that was evident in both "individual and collective self-interest" (ibid.). Focusing on the latter, a symptom and exacerbation of the former, Niebuhr rejected both liberalism's hope of societal perfection through love and good will, and orthodox Protestantism's unbridled relinquishing of political authority to government "on the ground God ordained it to prevent anarchy" (p. 129). Applied to our modern state, which is experiencing ever greater economic disparity, more global conflict, and pitiful incompetence from our two party system, Niebuhr's critique may be as relevant and powerful as in the mid 20th century. Speaking to Christians and contrasting idealism, Niebuhr said "[it is an] illusion to believe the kingdom of Caesar is the Kingdom of Christ in embryo" (p. 134). As the Christian realist, Niebuhr calls us to recognize that "every moment of human history [has] contained higher possibilities of good and every statesman [has the duty to correct injustices] so the vision of the Kingdom of Christ [is] not limited to a luxury limited for those whom transcended the effects of present injustices" (p. 134-135). Niebuhr doesn't say hope is lost in humanity, he is instead calling us to humility (realism) as we forsake idealism in search of a system that is ever mindful toward correcting its own bend toward injustice.

This highly dubious notion of humanity's ability to achieve perfection is attributed to humanity's state. Paralleling a kind of Augustinian dichotomy, Niebuhr identified sin through the means of either religious or moral expression (p. 137). Humanity, being both free and finite, operated under a sense of anxiety (p. 138). Our response to this anxiety is to mask finiteness by "raising [our] contingent existence to unconditioned significance" (p. 141) or to cope with freedom, "fall into sensuality, immersing self in ‘mutable good'" (ibid.). Ever cognizant of the collective, Niebuhr applied these forms of sin in the context of the social group.

Niebuhr used the phrase "equality of sin, inequality of guilt" (p. 153). Attributing pride to each individual and group, all are sinners. However, for Niebuhr not all individuals and groups were equally guilty of their sin. He writes "those who hold great economic and political power are more guilty of pride against God and of injustice against the weak than those who lack power and prestige." (p. 154). The more secure group exhibits a kind of pride of finite unconsciousness, exhibiting a self-sustaining and unrighteous control over lesser groups. The weaker groups, the oppressed, aware of this insecurity will seek security, but often do so at the expense of others (p. 142). The weak entity's sin proceeds in reaction to the powerful. One example that comes to mind is the toppling of Egypt's government. In the face of injustice, a weaker group consolidated and took control. However, as Niebuhr warned, the weaker group is always apt to continue the former abuses of the prior power. This is evident in Egypt as new power coalitions seek to perpetuate many of the same policies and doctrines enacted by the group they overthrew.

Niebuhr's writings urge us to recognize our inclination toward self-glorification or self-mutilation which perpetuates systems of injustice. He writes, "man's release from bondage to self involves emancipation from anxiety about death" (p. 197). Niebuhr states the "final law of human existence is agape, a movement of ‘grace' which draws the self out of itself despite itself into the love of God and the neighbor" (p. 196). Niebuhr, as a realist, calls for both secular and religious entities to operate in tandem, reminding each other of humanity's finitude while striving to keep social forces and political powers in check so "false sanctities and idolatries of both traditional societies and modern tyrannies are prevented" (p. 256). Niebuhr's realism is sobering but refreshing as he identifies why the ‘city of man' historically is in continual struggle. Through an Augustinian lens, he encourages humankind to acknowledge its imperfection, reject hope in the materialization of utopian society, and recognize a mandated duty to act within our limited capacity to bring about a more fair form of justice. A serious reflection upon and application of Niebuhr's work would be a benefit in our modern world which seems to continually suffer from greater brokenness. Especially as we move further into the 21st century, a century built on a globalized economy, and a delusion of bringing about perfection through technological prowess.

		<string>Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska. He was raised through much of his youth by his mother after his father's murder. Her mother, who was tasked with raising several children alone, would eventually suffer a nervous breakdown, causing Malcolm to move into foster care. At 16 Malcolm LIttle moved to Boston to live with his sister.

Here Malcolm would become fall into a life of crime, hustling, drug dealing, stealing, etc. Eventually, Malcolm was arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison. Here Malcolm began reading and studying until his family would introduce him to a movement called the Nation of Islam, a black separtist movement led by Elijah Poole (Elijah Muhammed). The Nation spoke to Malcolm, who had familiarity with a simliar movement run by Marcus Garvey, whom his father was a minister for. After leaving prison, Malcolm became a spokesperson for the Nation.

Malcolm X, the name he adopted as a member of the Nation of Islam, became a powerful critic of the United States, and its treatment of black citizens, Afro-Americans. He originally operated withing the theology and message of the Nation's leader, Elijah Muhammed. Tensions between the leader and messenger would eventually cause an irreconcilable, and inevitable, split.

As Malcolm expanded his theology to a more universal concept of humanity, he would become more interested in traditional Islam. Malcolm eventually made the pilgrimmage to Mecca, and officially became a member of traditional Sunni Islam. Malcolm changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. In 1965 Malcolm was shot and killed by members of the Nation of Islam.
        
Malcolm was a nationalist, and called for a separation of black people from white people. His views were based on his observation of an injustice system. Malcolm believed that Afro-Americans were born into a society that taught them they were innately a lesser people. Malcolm spoke powerfully against this system, urging the oppressed peoples to understand they were uniquely endowed by a divine creator. That they were valued by this creator, made in this creator's image. Malcolm claimed that white people robbed Afro-American's of their power, and that they were warranted in taking power back. Mainstream media pictured Malcolm as angry and hateful. Malcom was angry, but was so mostly against ideas, not as much against specific people. Further, Malcolm was consumed more by love of self, of his people, and of God than he was driven by hate.

Malcom X's beliefs offer a powerful critique of Western society and Western concepts of sin, specifically those concepts as established by Augustine and Reinhold Niebuhr. His voice has become a voice for a new nation of youth. Malcom remains a highly influential voice of American society.</string>
